2. `url_name`
3. `icon_format`
4. `set_root`
5. `part_of_set`

### How to contribute an Icon

When you filling json-template for some item, you can define Icon in 2 ways:
1. Define it as `remote://<direct_link_to_image>`

**Example:**
```
"icon": "remote://https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/0/0e/VoidProjectionsGoldD.png/revision/latest?cb=20160709035734"
```
In this way my script will download this image, do necessary changes to it, and then record into DB.

2. Define it as `local://<path_to_image_relative_to_this_dir>`

**Example:**
```
"icon": "local://icons/ololo.png"
```
In this way my script will copy this image, do necessary changes to it, and then record into DB.

### Sets, how to

No need to define sets in some special way.
Just create all parts of set, and item that represent set itself.
All other work will be handled by the script.

**For Example, Aklex**:

You just need to create:

1. `Aklex Prime Blueprint.json`
2. `Aklex Prime Link.json`
3. `Aklex Prime Set.json`

### Tags, wtf.

Tags will be used for quick filtering user profile, like:

How to define them? 

There is no strict way to do so, but you can use this logic:

1. Add item group, like `Blueprint` | `Mod`.
2. Add item type, like `Rifle` | `Warframe`.
3. Add additional definition, like `Prime` | `Corrupted` | `Huras`, `Rare`, etc.

For example Rare Rifle Mod should have `[Mod, Rifle, Rare]` tags.

### Drop locations \ NPC

`link` - link to wiki about location \ NPC. 
`name` - Name of the location \ NPC. 

### Modifying an existing item.

If you want to modify existing item, copy appropriate file from `items` folder into `queues_changes` and do desirable changes.

**Do not remove `_id` filed**


### Contribute Language

Currently i can support only `en` and `ru` localization for all items.

> If you want to add another language, be sure that you can support it in future.

> In additional, you'll need to update all items at once via pull request.
I can't apply half done translation ^^

Use one of [this](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) lang codes, to add new translation. 


## Contribution Workflow

1. New Item added into `queued_updates` folder as `%item_name%.json`-file.
2. Contributors do all necessary changes, contribute icon, provide translations, etc.
As result we should have correct `%item_name%.json`-file.
3. Admin reviews changes and apply updates to the Warframe.market DB.
4. New item will appear inside `items` folder, and new icon will be added to folder at Gdrive.
